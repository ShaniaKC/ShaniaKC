## Welcome to my github profile :smiley:

 I am a **Frontend Developer** on a mission to build software that solves ***real*** problems no one else has created a useful solution to. 
 
 I believe in learning everyday, so my stack is ever changing.
 
 
 Currently, it includes :
 * HTML/CSS ( obviously ) :wink:
 * Vanilla Javascript ( ES6/7/8/9 )
 * Jquery ( Yep, I still use it ) 
 * React :heart:
 * NextJs
 * SCSS/SASS ( love it! )
 * NodeJs / Express / MongoDB ( Although I prefer the front, I can hold my own in the back too ) :relaxed:
 
 When I'm not building world changing software :grin:, I build amazing websites for businesses, freelance on [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~019f8690046400fc21)  
 and write technical blogs on [hashnode](https://softbue.hashnode.dev/).
